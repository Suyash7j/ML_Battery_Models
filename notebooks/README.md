# Model Demonstrations

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks demonstrating hybrid and AI models for battery voltage prediction:

- `NARX.ipynb`: NARX model with circuit-level inputs
- `LSTMs.ipynb`: Recurrent models with delay structures
- `Koopman.ipynb`: Deep Koopman operator dynamics
- `GCN.ipynb` and `GraphNN.ipynb`: Graph-based voltage prediction

Each notebook supports closed-loop evaluation on transient/steady-state data.
